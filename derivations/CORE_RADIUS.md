# Derivation of the Quantum Information Core Radius ({core}$)

## 1. The Postulate: Information Saturation
In the CODE-GEO framework, the "Singularity" is avoided because matter/energy cannot compress beyond the **Planck Density** ($\rho_p$). At this limit, the "Information Degeneracy Pressure" balances gravitational collapse.

The maximum density allowed by the universe is:
6950\rho_p = \frac{M_p}{L_p^3}6950

## 2. Volumetric Mass Equivalence
For a black hole of mass $, the core must occupy a volume $ such that its density does not exceed $\rho_p$. Assuming a spherical core:
6950M = \rho_p \cdot V_{core}6950
6950M = \left( \frac{M_p}{L_p^3} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{4}{3} \pi R_{core}^3 \right)6950

## 3. Solving for {core}$
To find the physical radius where the math "rounds off" from a point to a sphere:
6950R_{core}^3 = \frac{3}{4\pi} \cdot \frac{M}{M_p} \cdot L_p^36950

By taking the cube root, we arrive at the "Suspicious" scaling seen in Equation (2):
6950R_{core} = \left( \frac{3}{4\pi} \right)^{1/3} \cdot \sqrt[3]{\frac{M}{M_p}} \cdot L_p6950

## 4. Conclusion
The cubic root is not an arbitrary choice. It is the **geometric consequence of 3D volume saturation**. While the event horizon ($) scales linearly with mass ($), the core radius ({core}$) scales with the cube root of mass ($\sqrt[3]{M}$) because it represents a **constant-density solid object** at the Planck scale.
