# Project CODE-GEO: Theoretical Lineage

Project CODE-GEO does not exist in a vacuum. It is a phenomenological extension of the following established research programs:

1. **Holographic Complexity:** Based on Susskind's "Complexity Equals Action" conjecture (2016). We extend this by coupling the action back to the Einstein Field Equations.
2. **QEC in Spacetime:** Based on Almheiri, Dong, and Harlow (2015) regarding Bulk Reconstruction from Quantum Error-Correcting Codes.
3. **Scrambling Time:** Utilizing the Maldacena, Shenker, and Stanford (2016) bound on chaos, applied to the GW250114 event horizon.
4. **MOND Phenomenology:** Re-interpreting Milgrom's (1983) acceleration constant as a vacuum-computational latency.
