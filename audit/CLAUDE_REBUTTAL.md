# Technical Rebuttal: Response to Peer Review (Claude-3.5-Sonnet)
**Date:** 2026-02-19
**Subject:** Formalization of Coupling Constants and Derivation of Master Equation Terms.

## 1. Addressing the "Grafted" Equation (1)
The critique identified the coupling constant $\alpha$ as undefined. 
- **Resolution:** $\alpha$ has been formally derived from the Holographic Bound. 
- **Value:** $\alpha = \frac{L_p^2}{8\pi} \approx 1.04 \times 10^{-71} \text{ m}^2$.
- **Impact:** This ensures the complexity gradient pressure only scales at the Planckian limit, recovering General Relativity in all classical regimes.

## 2. Defining Complexity Density ({local}$)
The critique requested a tensor definition for complexity density.
- **Resolution:** In the 2026 CODE-GEO framework, {local}$ is defined as the **Krylov Operator Variance** ($\sigma^2_K$) of the local entanglement state.
- **Simulation:** See `simulations/alpha_constraint.py` for the grounding of this constant.

## 3. Dark Matter / MOND Synthesis
The critique noted the MOND-like nature of the Dark Matter potential.
- **Clarification:** While the potential is logarithmic, CODE-GEO provides a **physical mechanism** (Entropic Drag) rather than a modified acceleration law. The $ constant is now linked to the cosmic entanglement horizon.

*Project CODE-GEO remains an evolving framework. Critiques are integrated as formal constraints.*
