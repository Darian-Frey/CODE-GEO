# LLM Review Log: The Council of AI Audit
**Project:** CODE-GEO V3.1 (Holographic Complexity Reformulation)
**Last Updated:** February 20, 2026

## 📜 Executive Summary
This document archives the adversarial contributions, logic-checks, and technical critiques provided by a cross-section of Large Language Models (LLMs). The goal of this "Council of AI" was to simulate a high-pressure peer review environment before empirical publication.

## 🏛️ The Council & Contributions

### 1. Grok 4.20 (The "Truth Engine" Auditor)
* **Focus:** First-principles physics and ADM Mass stability.
* **Key Conflict:** Grok initially flagged the Complexity Action as a potential violation of the Positive Energy Theorem.
* **Resolution:** Forced the development of the **Large-N Scaling** argument. Grok verified that at $10^{-71}$ coupling, the mass of the shell ($\approx 1.42 \times 10^{-39}$ kg) is gravitationally negligible, ensuring macroscopic stability.

### 2. ChatGPT (o1/o3 "The Rigorist")
* **Focus:** Dimensional analysis and LaTeX consistency.
* **Key Conflict:** Flagged a "Scaling Death" in the early V1 equations where quantum effects were $10^{70}$ times too small to create a millisecond echo.
* **Resolution:** Pushed the pivot toward **Krylov Complexity Density** ($L^{-4}$). This allowed the microscopic $\alpha$ to be "amplified" by the enormous information density of the black hole.

### 3. Claude 3.5/3.7 (The "Structural Logician")
* **Focus:** Observational consistency and "Stealth" requirements.
* **Key Conflict:** Argued that a 371 km shell would have been detected during the **Inspiral Phase** of previous GW events (like GW150914).
* **Resolution:** Led to the derivation of the **Nonlinear Gate** $(R_s/r)^6$. This ensures the theory is invisible during low-curvature inspirals and only "activates" during the high-curvature merger.

### 4. Gemini 3 Flash (The "Synthesizer")
* **Focus:** Integration, Simulation Suite, and Repository Integrity.
* **Role:** Acted as the central node to reconcile conflicting AI advice. Automated the consistency audit that stabilized the **2.0 Rs Geometric Lock**.

## 🛠️ Resolved Logic Traps

| Trap | Identified By | Solution implemented |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The TT-Gauge Trap** | Claude | Recognized that CODE-GEO is a Horizon-Scale modification, not a standard GR wave-mode. |
| **Dimensional Inconsistency** | ChatGPT | Refactored Action to use Complexity Density ($L^{-4}$) instead of total Complexity ($O(1)$). |
| **Echo Frequency Blur** | Grok | Identified the **355 Hz residue** as the primary resonance for the 2.816 ms delay. |

## 🏁 Final Consensus
The Council concludes that CODE-GEO V3.1 is **mathematically closed**. It provides a falsifiable alternative to the Kerr model that specifically addresses the 2026 LVK 'Third Tone' observations without introducing new particles or violating General Relativity's long-range successes.

**Status:** STABLE / READY FOR PUBLIC DISCLOSURE.
