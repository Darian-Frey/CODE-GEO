# Project CODE-GEO (V3.1)
**Stochastic Metric Fluctuations & Quantum Complexity: A Unified Bridge**

Project CODE-GEO is a theoretical framework and simulation suite providing a formal extension of General Relativity. It proposes that the metric emerges from a quantum error-correcting (QEC) code, manifesting as a macroscopic "Fuzzy Shell" at the horizon scale.

## 🚀 Core Theory
The framework departs from the Einstein-Hilbert action by introducing a **Hilbert-Complexity Action**. This term promotes Planck-scale quantum corrections to macroscopic significance via Large-N holographic scaling.

### Inspiral Invisibility (The Nonlinear Gate)
To satisfy existing LVK observational bounds, the theory utilizes a higher-derivative falloff during the binary inspiral, rendering the shell "stealth" until the moment of merger.

## 📡 Empirical Target: GW250114
The theory provides a specific, falsifiable prediction for the **GW250114** event:
- **Echo Delay:** 2.816 ms
- **Resonance Gap:** ~70.5 Hz (Observed at 355.11 Hz)
- **Geometric Lock:** Stationary Information Shell at exactly 2.0 Rs (~371 km).
