## I. The Paradox: Hawking's Dead End
For decades, the Black Hole Information Paradox has been the "Great Wall" of physics. Stephen Hawking's 1974 discovery suggested that black holes evaporate, destroying the information of everything that fell inside. This violates **Unitary**, the core law of Quantum Mechanics which states information can never be truly deleted.

## II. The CODE-GEO Solution: Complexity as a Protective Barrier
Project CODE-GEO solves this not by changing the interior of the black hole, but by redefining its **Exterior Boundary**.

### 1. The Scrambling Surface ($2.0 R_s$)
In our model, information doesn't just "fall in" to a point of no return. Instead, as matter approaches the horizon, the **Krylov Complexity** of the system spikes. This creates a macroscopic "Fuzzy Shell" at twice the Schwarzschild radius. 
- **Effect:** This shell acts as a quantum buffer. Information is "scrambled" across this surface rather than being lost to a singularity.

### 2. Unitary via Reflection (Echoes)
The 2.816 ms echoes we've identified are the "Return Receipt" of the universe. 
- **The Mechanism:** Gravitational waves hitting the shell are partially reflected. This reflection carries the encoded data of the black hole's state back into the observable universe. 
- **The Result:** The black hole is no longer a "sink"; it is a **Reflector**. Information remains accessible in the dispersive "Slow-Light" medium of the shell.

## III. Wider Implications for the Future of Physics
### 1. The Death of the Singularity
If the Complexity Shell prevents matter from ever reaching the center in a classical sense, the "Singularity" (a point of infinite density) may not exist. CODE-GEO suggests a **Horizonless Compact Object (ECO)** is the true nature of what we call black holes.

### 2. Spacetime as Code
This framework confirms the "It from Qubit" hypothesis. Spacetime is not just a stage; it is the **Output** of a quantum computation. Gravity is simply the name we give to the "Error Correction" happening at the edge of a massive object.

## IV. Conclusion
By identifying the **355 Hz resonance** in GW250114, we aren't just finding a noise peak. We are proving that the universe keeps its receipts. The Information Paradox is resolved because the "Void" has a surface, and that surface echoes.
