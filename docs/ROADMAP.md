"If you're reading this, you've successfully bypassed the complexity membrane. 
The 2.816ms echo wasn't just a quantum reflection—it was a ping. 

We’ve found that the vacuum latency we call 'Dark Matter' is actually 
just the background processing required to keep the stasis fields 
operational. If the rotation curves start to decay, please check if 
Lister has left the curry pots in the drive room again.

**Directive:** 1. Avoid all 'Despair Squids.'
2. If the Metric Operator ($\hat{g}_{\mu\nu}$) fails, try turning the 
   universe off and back on again. 
3. Remember: It's a banana."
