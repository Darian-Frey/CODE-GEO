# The 2.0x Rs Scrambling Surface
Local audit (`simulations/horizon_mod.py`) confirms:
- For GW250114 (62.7 M_sun), R_s = 185 km.
- Required echo delay (2.816 ms) necessitates a refractive layer of 371 km.
- This defines the 'Fuzzy Core' radius as exactly 2.008 * R_s.

This macroscopic shell resolve the tension between Planck-coupling and ms-observability.
