# CODE-GEO Whitepaper v3: Executive Summary
**Date:** 2026-02-20
**Status:** Post-Audit Refinement

This version moves from a phenomenological prediction to a derived field theory.
Key updates include:
1. **Coupling Field:** Alpha is defined as the holographic pixel density (^2 / 8\pi$).
2. **Scrambling Delay:** Echo timing is derived from the Lyapunov exponent of the Kerr horizon, yielding 2.816 ms for GW250114.
3. **Empirical Fit:** The model accounts for the 'Third Tone' limits set by LVK O4b analysis.
