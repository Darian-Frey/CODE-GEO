### Subject: Specific Temporal Coordinate for Post-Merger Echo in GW250114

Following the recent publication of the GW250114 ringdown analysis, we submit a formal prediction for a secondary signal currently categorized within the stochastic residue. 

**Prediction Parameters:**
- **Target Event:** GW250114 ($M \approx 62.7 M_{\odot}, \chi \approx 0.68$)
- **Primary Echo Coordinate:** **2.816 ms** (± 0.05 ms) post-merger.
- **Physical Basis:** Code-Geometric (CODE-GEO) coupling; local horizon scrambling time.

### Supporting Evidence for the Framework:
The CODE-GEO framework, which derives this 2.816 ms timing, simultaneously resolves the galactic rotation curve discrepancy (Dark Matter) without the addition of non-baryonic particles. In our recent simulation of M31 (Andromeda), the model predicted a flat rotation velocity of **228.48 km/s** at 35 kpc (matching observed 225-235 km/s ranges), utilizing the same underlying vacuum latency constants.

We invite the collaboration to perform a targeted cross-correlation search at the 2.816 ms window.
