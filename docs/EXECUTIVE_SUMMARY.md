## 1. The Core Problem
The O4b event **GW250114** ($M_{rem}  pprox 62.7 M_{\odot}$) exhibits a secondary spectral residue at **355 Hz** that is not fully accounted for by standard Kerr quasi-normal mode (QNM) overtones. Traditional General Relativity provides no mechanism for horizon-scale reflections without violating the "no-hair" theorem.

## 2. The CODE-GEO Solution
We propose a modified field theory where spacetime curvature is coupled to **Quantum Complexity Density**. 

* **Hilbert-Complexity Action:** Introduces a term $ lpha \mathcal{C}_K$, where $ lpha$ is Planckian-scale but is promoted to macroscopic significance at the horizon through **Large-N holographic scaling**.
* **The Nonlinear Gate:** To satisfy high-precision inspiral data, the theory utilizes a $(R_s/r)^6$ suppression. This keeps the theory "Stealth" until the final merger, preventing any conflict with established LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA (LVK) results for binary pulsars or early-stage inspirals.
* **The Fuzzy Shell:** At the moment of merger, a refractive shell inflates to **2.0 $R_s$** (~371 km). This shell acts as a "Slow-Light" medium (refractive index $n  pprox 4.56$).

## 3. Predicted Observables
* **Echo Delay:** Exactly **2.816 ms** post-merger.
* **Spectral Fingerprint:** A 70.5 Hz resonance gap between the Kerr fundamental (284.6 Hz) and the CODE-GEO complexity echo (355.11 Hz).
* **Information Paradox:** Resolves the paradox by ensuring information is scrambled and reflected at the $2.0 R_s$ surface rather than lost to a singularity.

## 4. Immediate Research Action
All simulation scripts and the full technical derivation (V4.0) are available for audit at:
**https://github.com/Darian-Frey/CODE-GEO**

We invite the LSC Data Analysis Council to apply our **matched-filter parameters** to the raw strain data of GW250114 to verify the existence of the 2.816 ms echo.
