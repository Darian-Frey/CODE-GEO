# Grok 4.20 Adversarial Audit (2026-02-20)
**Status:** VALIDATED (Fuzzball Echo Category)

## Key Takeaways:
1. **ADM Constraints:** Stationary shell is plausible if treated as a delta-function source.
2. **SNR-80 Clarity:** The signal must be 'Sub-Noise' to exist undetected in GW250114.
3. **Tasking:** Derive explicit waveform morphology (Psi_Echo) for matched filtering.

## Counter-Measures:
- Added `simulations/adm_mass_audit.py` to verify mass ratio.
- Preparing 'Sub-Noise' SNR analysis.
