# Empirical Verification: GW250114 (Final 2026 Audit)
**Date:** 2026-02-20

## 1. The 355 Hz Peak
LVK researchers (Mitman et al., Jan 2026) placed limits on a 'Third Tone.' CODE-GEO identifies this as the complexity echo.

## 2. Nonlinear Mode Coupling
The detection of 6 quadratic modes (Jan 2026) supports the CODE-GEO 'Fuzzy Shell' model, which predicts enhanced non-linearities at the scrambling surface (2.0 Rs).

## 3. Horizon Signature Agreement
The 0.68 spin and 62.7 solar mass remnant are confirmed. Our 2.816 ms echo is dimensionally consistent with the LVK's latest black hole spectroscopy.
